Based on the following description, generate a JSON object that represents the scene for 3D printing.

Description: "%s"

Use this JSON schema:
{
  "shapes": [
    {
      "type": "cube" | "sphere" | "cylinder" | "cone", // The type of primitive shape.
      "position": [x, y, z], // The center position of the shape.
      "rotation": [x, y, z], // Euler angle rotation in degrees around each axis.
      "dimensions": [width, height, depth] // Dimensions of the shape. For a sphere, only the first value (diameter) is used. For a cylinder or cone, the first is diameter and second is height.
    }
  ]
}

Only output the raw JSON object, without any surrounding text or markdown formatting. Ensure all values are numbers, not strings.
